# Interview

a job in the free market is only offered because the employer thinks he can get more money 
from the products of the employees work than the amount of money he pays the employee. 
This comes down the the two central questions one should ask oneself before the interview 
and that should be thought of in every step of the application:

- How do you get the employer more money?
- Can you create the product on your own in the required time frame?

## before all interviews

- Make sure that in case someone googles your name and email address he finds good stuff
- Write down your "life-story" about your professional development in case you are asked
- Write down several "developer-stories" about single things you build or problems you solved


## before each interview

- Set up informational pre interview or write personal email to interviewer to introduce you better
- Ask interviewer directly what he wants to speak with you about in the interview
- on site: make sure you look acceptable and wear nice clothes
- remote: check you hard and software like microphone, camera position and comunication programm
- be 10 min early
- prepare to speak one or two minutes about the company you are applying to
- prepare 30 seconds to two mintues "tell me about yourself" answer taylored to the position and company

## in the interview

  - think of every question as asking if you provide value
  - present things positive, evern if you don't know the answer

  - sidestep questions about your deficiencies 
  - try to figure  out what they need and present you as the solution to it
